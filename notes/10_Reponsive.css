Ideal Approach for Responsive Design:
Mobile-first approach: Start with the smallest screen size (mobile) and progressively add breakpoints for larger screens.
Flexibility for Larger Screens: For larger desktops, like 27-inch monitors or ultra-wide screens, use max-width constraints and min-width media queries to ensure content doesn't become too stretched or hard to read. Also, use percentages or viewport units (like vw and vh) to make layouts more fluid.
